\section*{Budget Constraint}

Suppose you have \$60 to spend on either good $x$, with a price of \$10, or good $y$, with a price of \$6.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] What is your budget constraint?

    \item[(b)] If you receive an extra \$30, the new budget constraint is?

    \item[(c)] If the extra \$30 is removed but the price of $x$ decreases to \$5, your budget constraint is?
    \item[(d)] Now go back to the setting in (a). Say good x offers a 50\% quantity discount on
extra goods purchased over 3 units. What does the budget constraint look like?
\item[(e)] Now go back to the setting in (a), but you are given a \$30 gift card for good x only.
What does the budget constraint look like?
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Utility Functions}

Consider the following utility functions:
\begin{align*}
    \text{(I)} & \quad u(x_1, x_2) = 4\sqrt{x_1 x_2}, \\
    \text{(II)} & \quad u(x_1, x_2) = 4x_1 + x_2, \\
    \text{(III)} & \quad u(x_1, x_2) = \min\{4x_1, x_2\}.
\end{align*}

\noindent 1. What is the marginal utilities of good 1 and 2?\\
2. What is the MRS (marginal rate of substitution) of $x_{1}$ for $x_{2}$?\\
3. Plot the indifference curves. 

\section*{Optimal Consumption Bundles}

Given the budget constraint:
\[
2x_1 + x_2 = 8,
\]
\noindent calculate the optimal consumption bundles for the above 3 utility functions.
